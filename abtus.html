                                    was created from an observation made between 2007, date of my beginnings in the Web on the code side, and 2012, date on which I wanted to transform what was then only a passion into a professional activity. During this period, I met a few (too many) people who had had trouble with unscrupulous web agencies and freelancers. Excessive billings, achievements made despite common sense were commonplace, when it was simply not the service provider who had vanished. Noting this a little too frequently for my taste, I then said to myself that there was undoubtedly a card to play in this fascinating universe if we had a minimum of ethics and were respectful of our customers.</p>
